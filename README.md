**React Movie Finder** is a simple movie search application built with **React** and powered by the **OMDb API**. Users can search for movies by entering a movie name into a search bar, and the app will display relevant movie information such as **movie posters**, **titles**, and **release years**.

The app is designed with a clean, minimal interface and aims to provide users with a smooth and intuitive movie discovery experience.
